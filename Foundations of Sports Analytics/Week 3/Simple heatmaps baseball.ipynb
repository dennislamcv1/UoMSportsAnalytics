    "\n",
    "In this notebook we're going to look at ways of visualizing performance in baseball. Our data was obtained from MLBAM (Major League Baseball Advanced Media) which make available online play-by-play statistics that can be used for data analytics. The data is produced annually, and in any season there are around 200,000 individual events in Major League Baseball. This data will prove extemely useful in the next course: Moneyball and Beyond. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis here is going to focus on where the ball was hit, which is recorded using (x, y) co-ordinates. This data is  easy to graph and is illuminating. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to look at five different ways to visualize the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Locations of hits broken down by singles, doubles, triples and home runs (for those not familiar with baseball this refers to base reached by the batter following a hit- first, second or third base, or, in the case of a home run, all run bases to score a run).\n",
    "2. Locations by hits (where the batter successfully reaches a base) versus outs (where the runner is caught or thrown out).\n",
    "3. Locations by handedness - to show the difference between lefties and righties.\n",
    "4. Locations by individual batters- to show how batters differ.\n",
    "5. Locations by stadium \n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs which show the distribution of locations are sometimes called \"heatmaps\" - because they show not only location, but the frequency with which a particular location appears. At a later stage we will look at the code for generating a more advanced heatmap, but in this notebook we're going to create very simple ones."
