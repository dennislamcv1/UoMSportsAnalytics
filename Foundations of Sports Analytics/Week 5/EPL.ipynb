    "# The Salary-Performance Relationship in the English Premier League\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week we looked at the salary-performance relationship in the NBA. The rules governing the operation of the English Premier League are very different. Unlike the NBA, there is no salary cap, nor is there a draft system, roster limits, and the revenue sharing mechanisms used in the NBA and other North American major leagues are much more limited. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important difference, which is not unconnnected, is the system of promotion and relegation. This requires that the worst performing teams in the league (measured by league position) are automatically relegated the following season to play in the next tier down, to be replaced by the best performing teams from that lower tier. This system is the norm in the world of soccer, and is perhaps the main reason that teams do not agree to restraints such as salary caps. There is a high degree of revenue inequality in soccer, and richer clubs are unwilling to share with the poorer ones, for fear that this might cause them to be relegated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we are going to follow the same procedure as we did for the NBA. We will look at the impact of salaries (relative to the average for the season) on team performance (measured this time by league position), and then see how the addition of potential omitted variables - (the lagged depedent variable and fixed effects) impact the estimates.\n",

By default Python uses the first name on the list as the reference group, and since our clubs are listed alphabetically, the reference group is Arsenal.
