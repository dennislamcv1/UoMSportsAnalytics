    "## From Run Expectancy to Wins Above Replacement (WAR)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Run Expectancy Matrix is a context-dependent measure of productivity. By introducing the context of a hit or a walk to the state of the game, it provides a more accurate measure of the contribution of a position player. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook we derived the Runs Value of an event, measured by the runs scored on the play, plus the Runs Expectancy at the end of the play minus the Run Expectancy at the beginning of the play. We also measured the season-long contribution of the position player as the sum of Runs Values across all plate appearances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Run Expectancy Matrix has been used in recent years to develop new ways of valuing player contributions. Because the underlying data has not been easily available until recently, and because deriving the matrix from the data was not easy in the past, the Run Expectancy Matrix has been adapted in simple ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebooks we looked at On Base Percentage (OBP) and Slugging (SLG). In recent years an increasingly popular statistic for measuring performance has been On-base Plus Slugging (OPS). OPS = OBP + SLG (hence the name \"On-base Plus Slugging\"). This measure is useful since it recognizes both the value of getting on base and extra value of doubles, triples, and home runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, as a measure of contribution, it implicitly imposes equal weights on each element of the formula. Is a double worth exactly twice a single in terms of runs scored? We shouldn't assume that - we should let the data tell us. This is exactly the idea behind the use of \"linear weights\" to calculate weighted on-base average (wOBA). The linear weights are taken from the Run Expectancy Matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different versions of wOBA out there depending on different adjustments preferred by different analysts. Remember that the Run Expectancy Matrix changes from year to year, and hence analysts like to evaluate a player relative to the RE Matrix of the season from which their stats are derived. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Fangraphs, a popular baseball statistics site, defined the following formula for wOBA in 2018:\n",
    "\n",
    "wOBA = (0.69*NIBB + 0.72*HBP + 0.88*1B + 1.247*2B + 1.578*3B + 2.031*HR)/(AB + BB - IBB +SF + HBP)\n",
    "\n",
    "where NIBB and IBB are non-intentional and intentional walks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights in wOBA are taken from the Run Expectancy Matrix. Sites such as Fangraphs and Baseball Reference generate these statistics, and then use the coefficients to generate measures such as wOBA, which they consider an improvement on On-base Plus Slugging (OPS).\n",
    "\n",
    "To take this further, analysts have created statistics to account for the total contribution of a player, one of the most popular being Wins Above Replacement (WAR). Most measures of WAR are based around calculations of wOBA for position players. We can summarize three aims in the creation of these statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    ">(i) To account for the four dimensions of on-field performance - batting, base-running, pitching, and fielding. The first two constitute offense, the last two defense. While base-running and fielding make a difference, it is batting and pitching which generate most value added in the game. One can think of pitching, in terms of the Run Expectancy Matrix, as the opposite of batting- if a play generates a positive Run Value for the batter, it creates an equal and opposite Run Value for the pitcher. \n",
    "\n",
    ">(ii) To adjust for differences in productivity which are unrelated to the skill of the player. The obvious adjustment here is for the size of the ballpark- some are easier for offense than than others, so player stats can be adjusted to take account of these differences. More subtly, a left-handed batter has an advantage over a right-handed batter when facing a right-handed pitcher - the so-called \"Platoon Effect\" - this advantage is often calculated and then deducted from the batter's Run Value.\n",
    "\n",
    ">(iii) To express the value of a player relative to a replacement player. If a player is injured, the team typically brings up a player from the minor leagues. Thus the true value of a player is his productivity relative to this likely replacement. Replacement value is usually calculated by averaging the statistics of players with a small number of appearances over the season, since these players are likely to be similar to players called up from the minors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have measured performance in terms of runs. For ease of interpretation (only), WAR is expressed in terms of wins, where a win is typically valued at around ten wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows we're going to focus only on batting (which is essentially offensive WAR) and ignore all of the adjustments. Not adjusting the figures might reduce their reliability, but our use of the RE Matrix has one big advantage over WAR based on wOBA. While Run Expectancy takes into account the context of an event, the linear weights are applied to average performance statistics over the season and are therefore not context dependent. Since we have the Run Expectancy Matrix to work with, our performance stats are context dependent."

    "# Writing a Function to Create the Runs Value of Each Event in a Season\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous workbook we used the MLBAM data for 2018 to derive the Run Expectancy Matrix and then create the Runs Value of every event. MLBAM has made available files in the same format for each season since 2014. Because the files are structured identically with identical names, we can turn the code into a Python function to produce the RE Matrix and Runs Values for any season, depending on the the file we choose. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function always starts with 'def'. Here the name Run_Expectancy is given to it, and it is defined by a path, which is where the data is to be found on which to execute the function. The content of the function (which must be indented) is simply a copy of all the lines of code used in the previous notebook, the only difference now is that the specific name 'MLBAM18' is replaced with a generic name 'RE', while the actual name applied when the function is run is defined when we specify the path. The function is completed by specifying 'return', the name of the output and a semi colon (;)."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "There is  high correlation between Runs Value and Win Percentage, especially in 2017. There is also a fairly high level of correlation between Runs Value in 2016 and Win Percentage in 2017 - it appears predictive to some extent. Runs Value is also fairly highly correlated with salary in a given year, but salaries in 2016 are not very closely correlated with Win Percentage in 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several possible explanations for this. Salaries are not as correlated with productivity (Runs Value) as one might expect in an open market, since rookies are not able to sell their services competitively and even 5 year veterans are constrained by arbitration (recall our analysis of salaries from Hakes and Sauer). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible that salaries are more about rewarding past performance than future performance. Your opinion on this depends on how you think the markets work. \n",
    "\n",
    "It may also be the case that salary data is partial and incomplete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Runs Value is a very good measure of player productivity, which improves upon traditional statistics by taking account of context. It's no accident that statistical analysis in baseball is more advanced than in any other sport - the natural measurement of performance as the product of a series of discrete homogeneous events (at-bats) is unparalleled in sports. Baseball analysts have gone further and made adjustments to these statistics to generate a single, intuitive measure of productivity such as Wins Above Replacement (WAR). There is debate about how to make these adjustments and different versions of WAR exist. In many cases WAR is calculated on the basis of season average player stats adjusted for Run Expectancy - a method which then loses the context dependent values we have derived here. In any case, equipped with the capacity to produce Runs Value data, you should now be able to go on and produce your own version of WAR, if you so wish. An example of how to do this is given by Baumer, Jensen, and Matthews (2015) \"openWAR: An open source system for evaluating overall player performance in major league baseball\", which you can download online for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course we have focused on the relationship between productivity, performance and valuation. We have focused mainly on using data to *explain* the relationships, but we have also seen that it can have *predictive* value. This is the underlying story behind Moneyball, but is is also the story of sports analytics in general. In the next course we will focus in more detail on prediction and forecasting."
