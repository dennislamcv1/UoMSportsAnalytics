A more authentic workflow is that we put specific libraries or functions in files which are meaingful based on what the file does, then we just import them into the notebook we are building. We're going to do that here. Now, I can't show you all the ins and outs of building deployable python packages here, but we'll do a bit of separation of concerns."

    "Good, now that we have official player stats ready to go from the NHL API we have to consider our Hart Memorial Trophy voting data. Now, the Hart votes are done by reporters who cover the NHL, and the voting procedure has stayed relatively constant from 1996 up until the 2020-2021 season. This last season, and the playoffs are actually going on right now while I'm filming, modified the number of reporters who could vote because of structural changes to the season due to covid. So, will the data from the 2020-2021 season be useful for next year? I don't know, it might be that the league changes the way the trophy is voted for next year too. What about this current analysis we're doing, would that be useful for the 2020-2021 season? I can't answer that either, since the Hart results haven't been shared yet! This would be a great place for you to extend this analysis though, and see what impact the covid year has on building models like this.\n",
